# fly2040
Basic RP2040 board.

Note - most of these boards require a 3.3V power supply when programming.
The intention is to be able to program the boards with a 1.27mm pitch test clip / pogo pins.
(See below).

The fly2040_min board is the recommended board to use at this time and has been tested and working
on V1/V2/Lite devices.

All other designs should be considered as work-in-progress and untested.

The usb-programmer board is designed to accept the P50-E2 (shaft diameter 0.68mm) which should be soldered in
to the (programmer) board.
