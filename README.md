# fly2040
Basic RP2040 board.
Not yet tested and going through updates.

There are currently 3 boards.

The fly2040 is an experimental board with line isolation and USB isolation.
The intention here is to be able to disconnect the lines when not in use.

The fly2040_min board is an attempt at making a single sided board as small
as possible.

The fly2040_ds is a tiny double sided board. The double sided board is tiny!! 
15mm x 12mm (0.59in x 0.47in)

Panels provided for fabrication.
